👋 Hi, I’m @Marcos-dotcom1  
👀 I’m interested in nothing, except maybe guitars and outsmarting people  
🌱 I’m currently learning nothing, because Google exists  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, unless you’re my wife  
📫 📫 **How to reach me:** don’t. Or do, I won’t answer    
😄 **Pronouns:** He/Him (but honestly, why do you care?)    
⚡ **Fun fact:** Otters are very aggressive and will kill you if you jump in their territory. Respect the otter  
🖥️ I build stuff for fun, not because I care  
🎸 I make guitars because everyone else’s are boring  
🇵🇹 Swiss-born, Portugal-bound, brain over biceps  
🔥 Most of my projects are unnecessary, but unnecessarily awesome
